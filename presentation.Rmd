# Introduction

# Methods

# Results
We will walk through how to reproduce some of the results from the paper.

First we need to install DER Finder from github and load any other necessary packages.
```{r install-packages, cache=T}
suppressMessages(library(devtools))
suppressMessages(install_github('derfinder', 'alyssafrazee'))

# need to install Genominator, limma, HiddenMarkov, splines, and locfdr
suppressMessages(library('Genominator'))
suppressMessages(library('limma'))
suppressMessages(library('HiddenMarkov'))

# splines and locfdr no longer exist.. we need to find online
library('locfdr')
library('splines')
```

Then we would need to preprocess our data.
- align reads using TopHat
- calculate coverage at each base
- merge files to create a matrix with coverage for each base in each sample

Then we load the data.

Then we run analysis at each base.

Then we fit an HMM to find DERs.

Then we get p-values for each DER.

Then we can annotate the DERs (optional).

I cloned Alyssa's github repo and have started analyzing the data there. I'll copy over the processed data and analysis scripts when that's complete.
